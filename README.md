# DOCKER_42

Hello friend !
I've finished this project a long while ago, but I really didn't find the time to add it to my project collection xd.

Anyways this was one of the best project ever, and one of my dear friends was the one motivating me to actually get into Docker.
<h2>What is Docker ?</h2>
We can say that docker is an engine to create containers. But then what are containers ?
<h4>What are containers ?</h4>
Containers are just like Virtual Machines, except instead of virtualizing the physical hardware... Containers virtualize the operting system.
Containers are lightweight, easy and more fast than Virtual Machines. And basically everything you can do in VMs, you can do it with containers.

Have fun working on this project, it is really worth it. :D
